/**
 @name The `BNCNetworkServiceProtocol` and `BNCNetworkOperationProtocol` protocols.

 @discussion
 The protocols `BNCNetworkServiceProtocol` and `BNCNetworkOperationProtocol` describe the methods
 needed to create a drop in replacement for the standard Branch SDK networking.

 See `Branch-SDK/Network/BNCNetworkService.h` and `Branch-SDK/Network/BNCNetworkService.m` for a
 concrete example of how to implement the BNCNetworkServiceProtocol and BNCNetworkOperationProtocol
 protocols.

 Usage
 -----
 
 1. Create your own network service class that follows the `BNCNetworkServiceProtocol`.
    The `new` and `networkOperationWithURLRequest:completion:` methods are required. The
    others are optional.

 2. Create your own network operation class that follows the `BNCNetworkOperationProtocol`.
    The `start` method is required, as are all the getters for request, response, error, and date
    data items.

 3. In your app delegate, set your network class by calling `[Branch setNetworkServiceClass:]` with
    your network class as a parameter. This method must be called before initializing the Branch 
    shared object.
